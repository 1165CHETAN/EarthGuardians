Poaching Prevention: Intensify anti-poaching efforts through increased patrols, intelligence gathering, and collaboration with law enforcement agencies.

Human-Tiger Conflict Resolution: Implement measures to mitigate conflicts between tigers and local communities, such as predator-proof livestock enclosures and compensation schemes for livestock losses.

Community Engagement: Involve local communities in tiger conservation through education, awareness programs, and the equitable sharing of benefits from tiger-related tourism and conservation initiatives.
