>Are Amazon parrots endangered? Out of 36 species of Amazon parrots assessed by the IUCN, five are endangered and four are critically endangered, namely the imperial Amazon, lilacine Amazon, Puerto Rican Amazon, and yellow-naped Amazon. Two species have gone extinct—the Guadeloupe Amazon and the Martinique Amazon.

Native to the island of Dominica, there are only 40-60 remaining imperial Amazon parrots. The primary threat they face is habitat degradation and loss due to hurricane damage. In 2017, Hurricane Maria destroyed 30% of Dominica’s forest cover, forcing imperial Amazons to forage outside of their usual habitat. Climate change is only worsening the severity of hurricanes.

Puerto Rican Amazons have an even lower population—fewer than 50 individuals. Hurricanes Maria and Irma have also had severe impacts on these parrots.

How long do Amazon parrots live? Depending on the species, Amazon parrots can live from around 30-50 years. Though they are commonly sought as pets, they are wild animals and do not make suitable family pets due to their long lifespans, destructive tendencies, and demanding needs.
