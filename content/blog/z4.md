>What is a bunting? Buntings are a family of passerine (perching) birds from Europe, Asia, and Africa. Related to finches, they eat seeds and are commonly recognized by their typically brown, streaked feathers and bold markings on their heads.

Why is the yellow-breasted bunting endangered? Not to be confused with the yellow bunting or the golden-breasted bunting, the yellow-breasted bunting is a species with a large range that extends from the eastern coastline of Russia all the way to Finland. In the winter, it migrates to South and Southeast Asia. Sadly, the yellow-breasted bunting is now extinct in Finland, Belarus, Ukraine, and large parts of Russia where it used to live. It is unknown how many of these birds are left across Asia, so there are no total population estimates, but the European population has declined to just 120-600 individuals.

Yellow-breasted buntings are increasingly being hunted, trapped, and illegally sold along other buntings for cooking, which has led to their decline. Increased agricultural activity has also depleted their winter habitats.
