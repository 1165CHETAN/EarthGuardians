>As its name suggests, the Regent Honeyeater feeds primarily on nectar from a small number of eucalypt plant species and other plant sugars. These birds play a crucial role as pollinators for many flowering plants. They can mainly be found in eucalypt forests and woodlands but land clearing, fragmentation and degradation of its natural habitats as well as competition for nectar from larger, more aggressive honeyeaters have driven its population to drop by more than 80% within three generations.

## Here are some ways to help save them:
>According to Cosmos Magazine, researchers' models suggest that the following actions could help save the regent honeyeater:
1. Release 100 birds into the wild every two years for 20 years
2. Protect nests from predators
3. Increase the number of zoo-bred birds released into the Blue Mountains over 20 years
4. Maintain a steady number of captive breeding efforts
5. Improve the quality and extent of the regent honeyeater's habitat
6. Restore and preserve more habitat
