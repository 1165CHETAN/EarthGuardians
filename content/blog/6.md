>There are only about 15 to 17 red wolves left in the wild in the U.S. In 1987, they were considered extinct, but a captive breeding program revived the species. Conservation efforts brought the population to over 100 animals around 2012, but by 2018, it dropped to 40 and now sits at less than two dozen.

## Here are some ways to help save them:
1. Population Monitoring and Management: Implement comprehensive monitoring programs to track the population size and genetic health of red wolves, along with active management strategies such as controlled breeding and relocation.
2. Habitat Restoration: Restore and protect suitable habitats for red wolves, including longleaf pine forests and other natural ecosystems in their historical range.
3. Community Engagement: Engage local communities in red wolf conservation efforts through outreach programs, education initiatives, and partnerships with landowners to promote coexistence.
4. Legal Protection: Advocate for stronger legal protections for red wolves, including enforcement of anti-poaching laws and regulations to prevent persecution and habitat destruction.
