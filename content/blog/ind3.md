## Here are some ways to save them:
Corridor Conservation: Establish and maintain wildlife corridors to allow snow leopards to roam between fragmented habitats, promoting genetic diversity and population resilience.

Livestock Protection: Implement predator-proof enclosures and compensation schemes for livestock losses to reduce retaliatory killings by herders.

Research and Monitoring: Conduct comprehensive research and monitoring programs to better understand snow leopard behavior, habitat use, and population dynamics.

International Cooperation: Collaborate with neighboring countries to coordinate conservation efforts and protect transboundary snow leopard populations effectively.
