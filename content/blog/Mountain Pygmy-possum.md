## Here are some ways to help save them:
1. Weed control to enable recovery of Mountain Plum Pine (Podocarpus lawrencei), a favourite source of food for Mountain Pygmy-possum. 
2. Revegetating habitat with appropriate species. Monitoring & control of pest animal species in Mountain Pygmy-possum habitats.
