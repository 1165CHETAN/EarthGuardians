>What is the New Zealand storm petrel? Native to the waters between New Zealand’s North Island and eastern Australia, the New Zealand storm petrel is a small seabird. Similar to the more common Wilson’s storm petrel, it has a black head, wings, and tail and a bright white stripe around its back. This bird only comes to land to breed and spends the rest of its life at sea.

Why is the New Zealand storm petrel endangered? It is estimated that fewer than 50 remaining New Zealand storm petrels. Researchers attribute their population decline to predation by invasive species, and they were thought to be extinct after not being observed for over a century. However, in 2003, they were rediscovered. They are now seen breeding on islands which no longer have rats and feral cats, so there may be hope for the New Zealand storm petrel’s recovery.
