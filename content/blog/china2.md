Tibetan antelopes usually inhabit on tablelands with an elevation of 3,400 to 5,500 meters, often moving on grasslands near water in the morning and at dusk. 

Male and female antelopes usually live in different groups of 2 to 6, or even tens or hundreds. It is born coward but alert, with sensitive hearing and vision ability, and usually appears in remote and unapproachable places. 

It migrates for long distances seasonally, feeding mainly on grass plants and sedge plants. The estrous period is in late winter and early spring, when male antelopes fight fiercely for female antelopes. A family is usually composed of one male antelope and several female antelope, and only one baby per propagation.

## Here are some ways to save them:
Anti-Poaching Measures: Strengthen law enforcement and anti-poaching patrols to combat illegal hunting and trafficking of Tibetan antelope for their wool (shahtoosh).

Habitat Protection: Establish and manage protected areas to conserve the high-altitude grasslands and plateaus that serve as critical habitat for Tibetan antelope.

Alternative Livelihoods: Provide alternative sources of income for communities traditionally involved in hunting or poaching Tibetan antelope, such as ecotourism and sustainable livestock management.

Research and Monitoring: Conduct research on Tibetan antelope populations, migration patterns, and habitat use to inform conservation strategies and monitor population trends effectively.
