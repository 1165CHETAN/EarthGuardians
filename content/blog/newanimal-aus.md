## Here are some ways to help save them:
1. Contact authorities
If you suspect or see a quoll near your hen house, contact your local land services or national parks and wildlife office. They may be able to help you trap and relocate the animal, or use a motion camera to identify the species.
2. Manage feral predators
Feral predators like foxes and cats can increase predation on quolls and compete with invasive species.
3. Create habitats
Quolls need large tracts of forest, especially those with older trees and hollows. They also need larger hollow logs on the ground, rocky outcrops, or areas with caves and crevices. These areas provide both shelter and an abundant food supply.
