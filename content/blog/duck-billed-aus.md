## Here are some ways to help save platypuses:
1. Report sightings: Report sightings of platypuses to your local waterway manager and the Australian Platypus Conservancy.
2. Clean up streams: Remove broken bottles and rubbish from streams.
3. Plant native plants: Plant native plants along stream banks to protect the banks and provide areas to live.
4. Avoid yabby traps: Don't use yabby traps to catch yabbies in freshwater streams.
5. Avoid plastic: Cut rings or circles of any sizes before throwing them in the rubbish bin.
6. Protect habitats: Restore and protect platypus habitats from droughts, bushfires, deforestation, pollution, and dams.
