>The Asiatic lion is about 10-20% smaller than its African cousins with a larger tail tuft and a distinct belly fold. As the name suggests, the Asiatic Lion was historically native across south-west Asia to eastern India.  

But now, the speciesâ€™ entire population can only be found in India and restricted to the Gir National Park and environs in Gujarat. Listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) since 2010, the Asiatic lion only has about 500-650 individuals left in the country.

## Here are some ways to save them:
Habitat Protection: Establish and enforce protected areas and reserves where Asiatic lions can thrive without human disturbance.

Community Engagement: Involve local communities in conservation efforts through education, awareness programs, and sustainable livelihood opportunities.

Genetic Diversity: Implement breeding programs to maintain genetic diversity within the Asiatic lion population to prevent inbreeding depression.

Anti-Poaching Measures: Increase patrols and deploy advanced technology like camera traps and drones to deter poaching and illegal wildlife trade.
