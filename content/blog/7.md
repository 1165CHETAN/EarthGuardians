>California condors are the largest bird in North America. In the 1980s, California condors nearly went extinct due to poisoning from lead and consuming DDT, a pesticide that was banned in 1972. A successful captive breeding recovery program increased numbers from six to 223 in the early 2000s. Today, there are over 400 California condors, but they still are threatened by human-related deaths, such as collisions with power lines.

## Here are some ways to save them:
1. Lead Poisoning Prevention: Implement measures to reduce lead exposure in condors, such as promoting the use of non-lead ammunition by hunters to prevent ingestion of lead fragments from carcasses.
2. Breeding and Release Programs: Continue captive breeding programs to increase the population size of California Condors, along with strategic releases into suitable habitats.
3. Monitoring and Research: Conduct ongoing monitoring and research to understand the factors affecting condor populations and inform conservation strategies.
4. Collaborative Conservation Efforts: Foster collaboration among government agencies, conservation organizations, and local communities to coordinate conservation actions and address threats to condor recovery effectively.
