>The scientific name of Black-Necked Crane is Grus Nigricollis (Latin), and belongs to the Gruidae family of Gruiformes order.

## You may not know!!

It is the only crane species growing and breeding in tableland, inhabiting in plateaus at an elevation of 2,500 to 5,000 meters. It usually lives in swampland, lake and overflow areas, feeding on green plant roots and sprouts, as well as mollusks, insects, batrachia, fishes, etc.

Every March, it leaves Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, the place where it hibernates, and flies northward to the prairies and marshy terrain of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and begins to breed in late April. The nests are usually built on grass piers or mud piers in marshy terrain with higher hypsography. The average number of eggs per breed is 2, and the incubation period lasts about 31 to 33 days.

## Here are some ways to save them:
Wetland Conservation: Protect and restore wetland habitats, including breeding and stopover sites, crucial for the survival of black-necked cranes during their annual migration.

Power Line Mitigation: Work with utility companies and government agencies to retrofit power lines and reduce collision risks for black-necked cranes, a significant cause of mortality.

Community Stewardship: Engage local communities in black-necked crane conservation through participatory programs, such as community-based ecotourism and stewardship initiatives.

International Collaboration: Collaborate with neighboring countries on transboundary conservation efforts to safeguard black-necked crane populations throughout their range.
