>Much like the Asiatic Lion, snow leopards used to have much larger habitats and prowled across the mountain ranges of Asia. Now, they can only be found in Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and the western and eastern parts of the Himalayas, with population numbers down to about 500 in India.

## Here are some ways to save them:
Corridor Conservation: Establish and maintain wildlife corridors to allow snow leopards to roam between fragmented habitats, promoting genetic diversity and population resilience.

Livestock Protection: Implement predator-proof enclosures and compensation schemes for livestock losses to reduce retaliatory killings by herders.

Research and Monitoring: Conduct comprehensive research and monitoring programs to better understand snow leopard behavior, habitat use, and population dynamics.

International Cooperation: Collaborate with neighboring countries to coordinate conservation efforts and protect transboundary snow leopard populations effectively.
