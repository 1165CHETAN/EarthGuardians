>The Chinese Alligator, also known as the Yangtze Alligator, was very abundant more than 230 million years ago, particularly on the eastern seaboard. But now, with a population of about 150 in the wild, it is listed as the world's most endangered creatures.

## You may not know!!

Chinese Alligators are good at swimming and inhabits in the water. They build their lairs in the thick grass of lakes and shallows. They usually stay in their lairs in winter and lay eggs in July and August.

Chinese Alligators are nocturnal. They often eat molluscs and fish, but are known to catch birds and mammals upon occasion. Due to the almost entire loss of low-altitude wetlands in the Yangtze River Basin, wild Chinese Alligator is almost extinct. In the past 30 years, there have been remarkable successes in the artificial breeding of Chinese Alligators. Thousands of stable-bred Chinese Alligators have laid the foundation for projects to reintroduce the specie back to the nature and recover the natural population.

## Here are some ways to save them:
Habitat Restoration: Restore and protect freshwater wetlands, marshes, and slow-moving rivers where Chinese alligators inhabit, ensuring sufficient habitat for breeding and foraging.

Captive Breeding: Establish and manage captive breeding programs to increase the population size and genetic diversity of Chinese alligators for potential reintroduction into the wild.

Fishery Management: Implement sustainable fisheries management practices to ensure an adequate prey base for Chinese alligators and minimize competition with local fishermen.

Public Awareness: Raise public awareness about the plight of the Chinese alligator and the importance of conserving this species through education campaigns, media outreach, and ecotourism initiatives.
