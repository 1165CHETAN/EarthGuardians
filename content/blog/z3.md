>What is the mangrove finch? The mangrove finch is a species in Darwin’s finch group, part of the tanager family, with dull brown, olive-toned, and white plumage. It’s native to the Galápagos.

As Darwin famously observed in this group of finches, the Mangrove finch has a beak specially adapted for its diet. Its long, pointed beak is used for lifting the scales of tree bark to grab insects underneath them.

Is the mangrove finch endangered? The mangrove finch is one of the most critically endangered finches. It has a decreasing population of only 20-40 individuals. The mangrove finch is declining due to threats of predation and parasites from invasive species.
